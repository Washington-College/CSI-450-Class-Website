## Background

Provide any necessary context. What concepts should readers understand before diving in?

## Main Content

This is where your main content goes. Break it into logical sections with clear headings.

### Code Example

Show your work with code blocks:

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| code-fold: false
#| warning: false

import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Your code here
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'x': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    'y': [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
})

plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))
plt.plot(data['x'], data['y'], marker='o')
plt.title('Your Plot Title')
plt.xlabel('X Label')
plt.ylabel('Y Label')
plt.grid(True, alpha=0.3)
plt.show()
```
